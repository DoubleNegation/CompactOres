# Compact Ores
CompactOres is a Minecraft mod that adds ores which yield extra resources.  
This mod is heavily inspired by [RWTema's Dense Ores](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dense-ores).
## Features
A compact ore is a block which mimics an ore from Minecraft or another mod. It has a different (automatically generated) texture from the ore block which it's based on, and drops several times more loot when broken.  
Compact ores can be heavily configured. For configuration instructions, please see the [configuration readme](src/main/resources/assets/compactores/default_config/config_readme.txt).
## Workspace setup
To set up the mod workspace, simply import `build.gradle` as a project into your IDE.
## Build Instructions
Windows: `gradlew.bat build`  
Unix/Linux: `./gradlew build`  
The resulting mod jar will be placed in `build/libs/`
